# differentialMethods

#### This repository contains methods of doing differential and integral calculus, as well as solving differential equations.

###### In differential calculus, this repository can find derivatives, locate minima/maxima, and construct taylor polynomials. It can also perform gradient descent on functions of one, two, or three variables.

###### In integral calculus, this repository can calculate Riemann Sums, the Monte-Carlo Method, and the Gaussian Quadrature.

###### For differential equations, this repository can utilize Euler's Method, Runge-Kutta 2, and Runge-Kutta 4.

##### Feel free to use any of the programs here.
